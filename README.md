**Project Title:** Cluster Analysis on Iris Dataset

**Objective:** Determine the optimal number of clusters for grouping Iris dataset samples and visualize the results.

**Approach:** Employ clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) with different numbers of clusters, evaluate their performance using metrics like the silhouette score or the elbow method, and create visualizations such as cluster plots or silhouette plots.

**Outcome:** Provide a clear visualization indicating the ideal number of clusters, facilitating data-driven decision-making for segmentation or further analysis of Iris dataset samples.
